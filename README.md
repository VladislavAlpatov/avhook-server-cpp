Welcome to the README.md file for our C++ server project!

This project is designed to provide a high-performance, efficient server implementation written in C++. Our server is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections, while still providing fast response times and low latency.

In this README file, you will find information on how to build, install, and run our server, as well as information on the various features and functionality it provides. We'll cover everything from system requirements and installation instructions to configuration options and API documentation.

We hope that this README file will provide you with all the information you need to get started with our C++ server project, and we look forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions. Thank you for considering our server for your project needs!

# API Documentation
Here, you will find detailed information about the various APIs exposed by our server, including their endpoints, input and output formats, and expected behaviors. This section is designed to help you integrate your application with our server, and to ensure that you are using our APIs correctly and effectively.

We recommend that you review this section carefully before using our server, and that you refer back to it as needed during development. If you have any questions or issues with our APIs, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.
